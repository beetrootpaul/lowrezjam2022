Enemies are approaching. There are 10 waves of them. We need to survive.

There are 3 types of towers you can build:

- **laser** - the fast one,
- **booster** - this one makes all surrounding lasers and v-beams shoot longer and re-charger faster,
- **v-beam** - the stronger one; its beam covers all tiles above and below, therefore you cannot build anything else on
  its way.

Our base have 5 cores. Each enemy is capable of destroying one core. Without cores, we cannot survive, it's that simple.

Good luck! You are our last hopeâ€¦
